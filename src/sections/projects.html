                Semeru Catering is a business profile website I developed for a
                home-based catering service, covering UI design and prototyping

                designed to help the general public learn SIBI (Indonesian Sign
                Language) through an interactive and accessible approach. The
                app integrates computer vision using a customized YOLOv11 model
                to recognize hand signs, combined with gamification elements
                such as levels, challenges, and interactive learning flows to
                improve user engagement. Built to support inclusive education,
                the application is optimized for smartphones with at least 4 GB
                RAM, 64 GB storage, and Android 13, aiming to encourage broader
