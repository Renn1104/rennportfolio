                Dark/Light Mode support. The app allows users to create tasks
                with precise date and time inputs, automatically sorts tasks by
                nearest schedule, supports status control (Done/Pending), and
                provides both single and bulk delete actions. It also includes
                real-time search and dynamic filtering (All, Pending, Done) with
                a responsive table view, making task tracking more organized and
                efficient.
